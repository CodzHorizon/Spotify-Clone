# 🎵 Spotify Clone

A fully responsive **Spotify Clone** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to simulate basic music player functionality with a custom UI and playbar. This project does not use any external libraries or frameworks. All songs are fetched using the `fetch()` API directly from a local `songs` directory, and it runs using the **"Go Live"** feature (VS Code Live Server).
